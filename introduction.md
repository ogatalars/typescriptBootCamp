- The Case for Typescript
    - Javascript is quirky (wierdo programming language)
    - Js was never meant to be the language that is used today. So basically, everything has js, that is something that js was not meant to be…
    - Typescript is Javascript with types. Types system.
- Typescript Overview
    
    Types → what is it?
    
    Typescript detects errors in our code without running it. This i called static checking. 
    
    Type Checking → Typescript does this error checking on the basis of the kind of data in our program aka Types!  
    
    Why types? Help us find errors! Analyzes our codes; 
    
    ```jsx
    const shape = {width: 10, height: 23}
    const area = shape.width * shape.heigth // typescript is going to alert us that is an error there
    ```
